# Think Outside The Box
This was the first web game, and even sort of cyber security related game I made when I was 12.
The concept was that you had to move between web pages by finding the "real" way to get to the next one hidden on the page.
No more than 3 levels were ever made. Maybe one day a 4th will come out.
